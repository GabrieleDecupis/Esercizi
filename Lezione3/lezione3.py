# 4-1. Pizzas: 
# Think of at least three kinds of your favorite pizza. 
# Store these pizza names in a list, and then use a for loop to print the name of each pizza.
# • Modify your for loop to print a sentence using the name of the pizza, instead of printing just the name of the pizza. 
# For each pizza, you should have one line of output containing a simple statement like I like pepperoni pizza.
# • Add a line at the end of your program, outside the for loop, that states how much you like pizza. 
# The output should consist of three or more lines about the kinds of pizza you like and then an additional sentence, 
# such as I really love pizza!

print("Esercizio 4-1 \n")
favourite_pizza: list = ("Margherita", "Boscaiola", "Diavola")
print(favourite_pizza)
print()
for x in range(len(favourite_pizza)):
    print(f"I like very much the {favourite_pizza[x]}")
    print(f"I love this type of pizza \n")
print()

# 4-2. Animals: 
# Think of at least three different animals that have a common characteristic. 
# Store the names of these animals in a list, and then use a for loop to print out the name of each animal.
# • Modify your program to print a statement about each animal, such as A dog would make a great pet.
# • Add a line at the end of your program, stating what these animals have in common. You could print a sentence, 
# such as Any of these animals would make a great pet!

print("Esercizio 4-2 \n")
