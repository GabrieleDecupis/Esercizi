# Esercizio 1

# The Number of Beautiful Subsets: write a function with an array nums of positive integers and a positive integer k given as inputs. 
# A subset of nums is beautiful if it does not contain two integers with an absolute difference equal to k. Return the number of non-empty 
# beautiful subsets of the array nums. A subset of nums is an array that can be obtained by deleting some (possibly none) elements from nums. 
# Two subsets are different if and only if the chosen indices to delete are different.

# Example 1:
# Input: nums = [2,4,6], k = 2
# Output: 4

# Example 2:
# Input: nums = [1], k = 1
# Output: 1
